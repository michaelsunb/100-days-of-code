- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/1402_Reducing_Dishes.cs)

**Thoughts** This code sorts the satisfaction levels of dishes, then checks them in reverse order, adding up the like-time coefficient for each dish if it's positive, ultimately returning the maximum sum of like-time coefficients. It helps the chef find the best order to cook dishes to maximize people's satisfaction.
