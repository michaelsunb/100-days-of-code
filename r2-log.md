# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Michaelsun Baluyos](https://www.MichaelBalyuos.com)

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 28, Saturday, 2022].

## Log

### R2D1 September 28, 2022
- [Leetcode 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/19%20Remove%20Nth%20Node%20From%20End%20of%20List.java)

**Thoughts** Restart 100 days of code. Failed the first round because I ran into life problems which were out of my control. Today's LeetCode problem was interesting. I used the fast - slow point technique as explained in [https://iq.opengenus.org/fast-and-slow-pointer-technique/](https://iq.opengenus.org/fast-and-slow-pointer-technique/)

### R2D2 September 29, 2022
- [Leetcode 658. Find K Closest Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/658%20Find%20K%20Closest%20Elements.py)

**Thoughts** Tried answering using the Python language. Python is interesting as we don't need to worry about semi-colons and curley brackets. A change in mindset because need to only care about indentations.

### R2D3 September 30, 2022
- [Project Euler 5. Smallest multiple](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)
- [Project Euler Answer](Euler/5_Smallest_Multiple.js)

**Thoughts** Did a project Euler question using javascript and node. Answer was 232792560.

### R2D4 October 1, 2022
- [Leetcode 91. Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/91_Decode_Ways.js)

**Thoughts** Did a Leetcode problem in Javascript again. Also from here on, I think its best to replace the spaces in filename with underscores. Also decided to remove Hackerrank, since it's basically the same as Project Euler.
