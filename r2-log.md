# #100DaysOfCode Log - Round 2 - [Michaelsun Baluyos](https://www.MichaelBalyuos.com)

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [September 28, Saturday, 2022].

## Log

### R2D1 September 28, 2022
- [Leetcode 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/19_Remove_Nth_Node_From_End_of_List.java)

**Thoughts** Restart 100 days of code. Failed the first round because I ran into life problems which were out of my control. Today's LeetCode problem was interesting. I used the fast - slow point technique as explained in [https://iq.opengenus.org/fast-and-slow-pointer-technique/](https://iq.opengenus.org/fast-and-slow-pointer-technique/)

### R2D2 September 29, 2022
- [Leetcode 658. Find K Closest Elements](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-k-closest-elements/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/658_Find_K_Closest_Elements.py)

**Thoughts** Tried answering using the Python language. Python is interesting as we don't need to worry about semi-colons and curley brackets. A change in mindset because need to only care about indentations.

### R2D3 September 30, 2022
- [Project Euler 5. Smallest multiple](https://projecteuler.net/problem=5)
- [Project Euler Answer](Euler/5_Smallest_Multiple.js)

**Thoughts** Did a project Euler question using javascript and node. Answer was 232792560.

### R2D4 October 1, 2022
- [Leetcode 91. Decode Ways](https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/91_Decode_Ways.js)

**Thoughts** Did a Leetcode problem in Javascript again. Also from here on, I think its best to replace the spaces in filename with underscores. Also decided to remove Hackerrank, since it's basically the same as Project Euler.

### R2D5 October 2, 2022
- [Leetcode 1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/1155_Number_of_Dice_Rolls_With_Target_Sum.py)

**Thoughts** Leetcode problem again using Python. Doing for the Daily streak. On a 5 day streak now :)

### R2D6 October 3, 2022
- [Leetcode 1578. Minimum Time to Make Rope Colorful](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/1578_Minimum_Time_to_Make_Rope_Colorful.js)
- [Project Euler 6. Sum square difference](https://projecteuler.net/problem=6)
- [Project Euler Answer](Euler/6_Sum_square_difference.php)

**Thoughts** Leetcode problem using Javascript. Simple for loop that checks if current index is not the same as previous. If so, then reset the count. Also did a Project Euler question late in the evening. This Project Euler question was interesting and a bit easy.

### R2D7 October 4, 2022
- [Leetcode 112. Path Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/path-sum/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/112_Path_Sum.php)
- [Project Euler 7. 10001st prime](https://projecteuler.net/problem=7)
- [Project Euler Answer](Euler/7_10001st_prime.py)

**Thoughts** Leetcode problem using PHP and Project Euler done in Python. Both easy  :)

### R2D8 October 6, 2022
- [Leetcode 623. Add One Row to Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/add-one-row-to-tree/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/623_Add_One_Row_to_Tree.cs)

**Thoughts** Leetcode problem done late in the middle of the night. Now 12:23am and just finished. So technically did not miss a day. Coded in C# :)

### R2D9 October 7, 2022
- [Leetcode 981. Time Based Key-Value Store](https://leetcode.com/problems/time-based-key-value-store/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/981_Time_Based_Key-Value_Store.php)
- [Project Euler 8. 10001st prime](https://projecteuler.net/problem=8)
- [Project Euler Answer](Euler/8_Largest_product_in_a_series.cs)

**Thoughts** Today's Leetcode problem was interesting. Nobody in the discussions has done it in PHP, thus I took on the challenge to write it in PHP :) Also did Project Euler question. At first I didn't understand the question, but once I dug through it, I understood and was able to answer it.

### R2D10 October 8, 2022
- [Project Euler 9. Special Pythagorean triplet](https://projecteuler.net/problem=9)
- [Project Euler Answer](Euler/8_Largest_product_in_a_series.cs)

**Thoughts** Just one Project Euler done today. Done in Java. I like doing Project Euler questions over Leetcode because I find that Euler questions are not that hard but is interesting at the same time.

### R2D11 October 9, 2022
- [Leetcode 16. 3Sum Closest](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum-closest/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/16_3Sum_Closest.py)

**Thoughts** Day 11 done in Leetcode. Tired but still do it for the challenge

### R2D12 October 10, 2022
- [Project Euler 10. Summation of primes](https://projecteuler.net/problem=10)
- [Project Euler Answer](Euler/10_Summation_of_primes.js)

**Thoughts** Day 12 Project Euler. At first tried to do it in python since I already have a Prime function from problem 7 but for primes under 2 million took too long. So ended up doing in Javascript. 

### R2D13 October 12, 2022
- [Leetcode 334. Increasing Triplet Subsequence](https://leetcode.com/problems/increasing-triplet-subsequence/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/334_Increasing_Triplet_Subsequence.js)

**Thoughts** Almost missed today due to other commitments. Thought I understood the problem until I ran into multiple test cases that failed. In the end, I eventually got the answer.

### R2D14 October 12, 2022
- [Leetcode 976. Largest Perimeter Triangle](https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-perimeter-triangle/)
- [Leetcode Answer](Leetcode/976_Largest_Perimeter_Triangle.php)

**Thoughts** Easy question if you know about triangles. A+B>C
